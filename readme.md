# Backend Coding Assignment

Below is an outline of a project we'd like you build.

Imagine you are an early employee at twitter, and have been asked to implement some core backend features.

the core features are:

- Register using email and password
- Login using email or username and password
- Users can Subscribe to hashtags
- Post tweets of 140 character or less with embedded hashtags.
- Notify all people who subscribed to the hashtags about a new tweet containing the hashtags they are subscribed to.
- Include any assumptions made in the email reply, as well as list any gem that is needed.

Include all the attributes, associations, validations, callbacks and the methods you will need to make this work.

We have put together a few small Ruby classes and some basic test cases to help kick things off. You do not need to turn this into a full blown Rails application, act as if these are Rails models and stub any Rails services that you might need ( IE a mailer and database ). The tests are currently a vague outline. They can, and should, be changed and added to to show what you know, but they are OPTIONAL.

When finished with this exercise, please zip up the package of code and send it back to your point of contact.

Let us know if you have any questions.

Thank you!
